- Add an Array loop to sort out not changed states. So TP dont get useless states.

- Add more Options to the Site
- Input Field not working (Interface)




- Events not working



OK, so I did some further testing of things I would like to use in ATS - this is a list of things I noticed:
Event: Engine ON - not working
Event: Park Break ON - not working
Dynamic Text for Lights Beam Low ${value:Nybo.ETS2.Dashboard.LightsBeamLowOn} shows true - using If statement of touchportal it is the oposite (Lights Beam Low On evaluates true if they are off)
Lights Beam High On - not Working
Hazard Lights On - not Working
Cruise Control - ${value:Nybo.ETS2.Dashboard.CruiseControlSpeed} is it possible to show this in Miles per hour and rounded numbers (Integers) for ATS?
Remaining Time - ${value:Nybo.ETS2.Dashboard.JobRemainingTime} - gives me something like: 0001-01-02T01:17:00Z is it possible to Format this, what does it mean?
${value:Nybo.ETS2.Dashboard.SpeedLimit} Shows the Speed Limit in Kmh, is it possible to show in Mph
${value:Nybo.ETS2.Dashboard.Speed} Actual Speed shows Kmh, is it possible to show in Mph
${value:Nybo.ETS2.Dashboard.JobEstimatedDistance} Estimated Distance: Can you show that in miles, rounded to one digit after the point (1.4 Mi)
${value:Nybo.ETS2.Dashboard.JobIncome} Jobg income gives me something like 4622undefined - can it show 4622 $ instead?

Is it generally possible to calculate with your values in the dynamic Text Edit

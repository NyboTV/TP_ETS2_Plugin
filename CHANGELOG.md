# Changelog: What's new in V2?

A complete overhaul designed for better performance, easier setup, and a cleaner look.

## 🌟 Major Highlights

### 🎨 All-New Dynamic Gauges
- **No more image files**: All dials (Speedo, RPM, Fuel) are now drawn directly by the plugin. This means they are sharper and use less system resources.
- **Improved Speedometer**: The scale is now more detailed at lower speeds (up to 100 km/h) and compressed at higher speeds for a more realistic feel.
- **Customizable**: You can now change colors, fonts, and needle styles in the settings.

### 🛠️ Smart Installation
- **Automated setup**: The plugin now automatically finds where your game (ETS2 or ATS) is installed.
- **Easy Telemetry Setup**: A new guided process helps you install the necessary telemetry link with just a few clicks.

### 💻 Better Compatibility
- **Cross-Platform**: Built to work smoothly on Windows, Linux, and macOS.
- **Self-Contained**: The plugin comes with everything it needs to run—no extra software installations required.

### ⚡ Performance & Reliability
- **Faster updates**: Data is now processed more efficiently, leading to smoother gauge movements.
- **Safe Settings**: Your settings are now automatically backed up and restored when you update.

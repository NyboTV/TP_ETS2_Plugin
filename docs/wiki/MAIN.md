## How to create a Button

First click on a Button (Square) in Touch Portal. A New Window appears.

Now if you want a "dynamic text value", for example for the gear, just click on "Logic" in the left bar and then on "Dynamic Text Updater".
Now you can click on the "+" and go to my plugin and find the value you want. After that click on "Save" and open the page on your mobile. Now you can see the value on your mobile.

If you want a "display" like for the fuel, proceed in the same way, but now click on "Values" and then on "When button state changes". Now go to "Visuals" and click on "Change visuals by plug-in state". Now make the following settings in the "On Event" tab: 
"When the plug-in state [choose any state, preferably "Speed Gauge"] [choose "does not change to"] [leave it blank]. 
Then "Change the 'Icon' with the value from the plug-in state [your display that you want]".
